# cafecounter
A website that finds cafes near you and allows you to review them for your own personal coffee review.
 
## Purpose
I am using this project as a way to test and develop my skills as a front end software developer. It will be a way to compare my progress in real time and see how the project will develop as I learn more. 

The final goal is to have this as a React app that can pull from GPS APIs and act as a personal review source to keep track of which cafes I actually enjoy going to.
